hope you are ok. We decided to move forward and send you our challenge.
To give you some context: we absolutely love cats! And we would love for you to build us an app that is a tinder for cats.


As explained, we sent the exercise through e-mail and you should access here the design link (https://www.figma.com/file/QKSnYUt7BqSWN6sL0dBFZE/cat-tinder?node-id=0%3A1).

If you don't have an account please create it. You have up to 5 hours if you need to, to complete the tasks and it will be available for the next 3 days, until 16/05/2022. Please be aware You can't pause the exercise (You should upload your project on github with a first commit from when it started and then the final commit, before the time is up). Also, you can use the libraries you feel comfortable with, and if you do some Unit Tests that will for sure touch our hearts!
Endpoints to consider:
Cat list: https://docs.thecatapi.com/api-reference/breeds/breeds-list. Here you will get info like Name, Cat Photo, Origin and Affection Level. This info will be used on the cat info bar.
Vote: https://docs.thecatapi.com/api-reference/votes/votes-post. Here you will find the endpoint to vote on your favourite cats.
Any questions you have, don't hesitate to contact us.
Thanks,
